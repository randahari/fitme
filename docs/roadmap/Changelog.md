## v2.18.0 — REM-001 Nutrition Output Validation

**Date:** 2026-07-16  
**Status:** Merged to `main`

### Added

- `js/nutritionValidator.js` — shared pure deterministic validator.
- Validation statuses: `VALID`, `REVIEW_REQUIRED`, `REJECTED`.
- Hard validation for malformed, missing, negative, non-finite and contradictory nutrition values.
- Soft validation for macro completeness, macro/calorie mismatch and zero-value plausibility.
- Minimal review/recovery handling for suspicious or rejected AI estimates.
- `tests/nutritionValidator.test.js` with 26 automated tests.
- Architecture remediation plan.
- Approved REM-001 specification.

### Changed

- Every approved AI nutrition entry path now uses the shared normalization and validation layer.
- AI-generated nutrition is validated immediately after normalization.
- Final edited values are validated again before authoritative persistence.
- Invalid AI values are no longer silently coerced to zero.
- Transient nutrition-analysis state is cleared on authentication reset/sign-out.
- `APP_VERSION` and service-worker cache version advanced to `2.18.0`.

### Verification

- Engineering Readiness Review: `READY`.
- Automated tests: `26 passed / 0 failed`.
- Scope check confirmed no changes to Firebase Functions, Firestore rules, Habit Engine, Pattern Engine, Trigger Engine or Adaptive TDEE logic.
- Broad manual end-to-end QA is deferred to the planned AI-core integration checkpoint.

### Deployment

- Static application changes only.
- Published by commit and push to the configured GitHub Pages branch.
- No Firebase deploy required.
